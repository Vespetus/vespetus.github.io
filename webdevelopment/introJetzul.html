    Hiya! My name is Jetzul Andrade and I am a Digital Storytelling major here at Mizzou. I use they/them pronouns and I am originally from Mexico. I am currently a senior soon to graduate this spring.  I have dabbled before in coding, though at a very hobbyist level. Ever since I was little I have had a deep, deep love for the old web— back when individual webpages were more common. I’ve have attempted to start with editing already realized blogs with HTML but struggled a lot to stick to it. However, I did use very basic HTML alongside the program Twine in order to create a very short narrative visual novel type game. Outside of that, I am very much new to both HTML and CSS. I hope by the end of this course to have at least a decent enough website I can use as an art portfolio and be able to modify it to my heart’s content. Aside from that, I also hope to fully immerse myself in the still living old web in neocities and create a personalized website. Having my own corner on the internet would really be a dream come true and I admire everyone who is still doing it. Seeing how impermanent the current state of the web is, I rather have a place to call my own. I love animation, film, video games, reading, D&D, and writing. Honestly, if I even have the time I try to at least draw or get some time to play some games.
