    Hiya! My name is Jetzul Andrade but I also go by Jet. I am a Digital Storytelling major here at Mizzou. My focus is in 2D animation. I use they/them pronouns and I am from Mexico. I am a senior soon to graduate this spring.  I have dabbled before in coding, though at a very hobbyist level. Ever since I was little, I loved the old web and individualized webpages. I tried to learn to code by editing my first Tumblr blog with HTML, but failed. I did learn to code a basic game using Scratch in high school once. Here at Mizzou I used very basic HTML in Twine to create a narrative visual novel game for one of my Digital Storytelling classes. Still, I am very much new to both HTML and CSS. My hope is that with this class I will be able to make my own portfolio website.  A website just for me to edit however I want. I also want to make my past dream come true. I want to join the still alive old web in neocities. I want to create a personalized website where I can talk about hobbies. I also want to share art and join webrings. Having my own corner on the internet would  be a dream come true. I admire everyone who is still doing it. I enjoy drawing, reading, playing video games, listening to music, and watching movies and shows.
